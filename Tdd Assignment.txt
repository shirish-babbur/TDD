Tdd for Login Systems:

Sample set input for this system is

[	{correct username,correct password},
	{blank username,correct password},
	{blank username,Wrong password},
	{Correct username,blank password},
	{Wrong username,blank password},
	{blank username,blank password},
	{Correct username,Wrong password},
	{Wrong username,Correct password},
	{wrong username,wrong password}
]

Sample set of output is

[	login successgully,
	ERROR,
	ERROR,
	ERROR,
	ERROR,
	ERROR,
	ERROR,
	ERROR,
	ERROR,
]

The positive input for this will be the subset,which will successfully login is this:

[	{correct username,correct password}	]


The negative input for this will be the subset which will yield an error is this:

[	{blank username,correct password},
	{blank username,Wrong password},
	{Correct username,blank password},
	{Wrong username,blank password},
	{blank username,blank password},
	{Correct username,Wrong password},
	{Wrong username,Correct password},
	{wrong username,wrong password}
]

So the acceptance criteria will be as follows:

when we will have correct username and correct password  the result is Login Successfully.
when we will have blank username and  correct password the result is ERROR.
when we will have blank username and  Wrong password the result is ERROR.
when we will have correct username and blank password  the result is ERROR.
when we will have Wrong username and blank password  the result is ERROR.
when we will have blank username and  blank password the result is ERROR.
when we will have Correct username and Wrong password  the result is ERROR.
when we will have Wrong username and Correct password  the result is ERROR.
when we will have  Wrong usernameand Wrong password  the result is ERROR.
